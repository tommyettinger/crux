## Shared interfaces for point types

This library provides some small interfaces meant to be shared by (subclasses of)
various incompatible types such as libGDX's GridPoint2, Vector2, GridPoint3, and
Vector3, as well as SquidSquad's Coord, and potentially AWT's Point. The code here
was pulled from [gand](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gand), and now gand
depends on this.
